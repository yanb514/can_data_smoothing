# can_data_smoothing

This repository provides a tool for smoothing CAN bus data, incluing position, velocity and acceleration, while preserving internal consistency.
For details of problem formulation please refer to the PDF ![](https://github.com/yanb514/can_data_smoothing/blob/main/can_bus_smoothing_doc.pdf).

### Requirement
- CVXOPT: https://cvxopt.org/userguide/index.html

### Results with different parameter choices
lam1 = 1, lam2 = 10, lam3 = 10

### This version handles
- complete time series data, no missing data
- uniform timestamps (e.g., 10Hz)
- forward Euler numerical discretization method
- measurement noise, no sparse outliers (otherwise, a L1 regularization is necessary)

It is necessary to standardize the data into the above format before applying this smoother. Additional features can be made upon request.
